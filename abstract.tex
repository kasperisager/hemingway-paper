Goal of this paper is to measure various metrics of one of the latest developments in locality-sensitive hashing - called Covering LSH.
However, all theoretical proofs and concepts always need to be backed up by practical, real world experiments .To perform such an experiment we need to implement our concept. By doing that it is required to take multiple factors into equation. Many high-level languages, tools, and frameworks have a lot of drawbacks and make assumptions which can compromise the results of the conducted experiments. Our intention is to use C++ language and both real and synthetic datasets to produce trustworthy results.

\begin{abstract}
Recent years have introduced many developments in locality-sensitive hashing techniques. However, the theoretical proofs and concepts always need to be backed up by practical, real-word experiments. To perform such an experiment we need to implement our concept. By doing that it is required to take multiple factors into equation. Many high-level languages, tools, and frameworks have a lot of drawbacks and make assumptions which can compromise the results of the conducted experiments. Our goal is to measure various metrics of one of the latest developments in locality-sensitive hashing on real and synthetic data by providing a general implementation in a native programming language.

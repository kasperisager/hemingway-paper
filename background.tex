\section{Background}

As touched upon in section \ref{introduction}, locality-sensitive hashing tackles the problem of similarity search in high-dimensional datasets by relaxing the requirement of finding exact nearest neighbours. Instead, LSH is used as an \textit{approximate} nearest neighbour algorithm, which inheritly implies only probabilistic guarantees of finding a nearest neighbour. In general, LSH schemes act as randomized filters that attempt to reduce an input set to a subset of candidates for a given query item.

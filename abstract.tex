Recent years have introduced many development in so called Locality Sensitive Hashing techniques. But the theoretical proofs and concepts always needs to be backed up by practical, real word experiments. But to hold such a experiment we need to implement our concept. By doing that it is required to take multiple factors into equation. Many high level languages, tools and frameworks has a lot of drawbacks, assumptions which can compromise the results of conducted experiment. Our intention is to measure various  metrics of one of the latest LSH developments on the real and synthetic data by providing implementation in native programming language.

Introdcution to the problem why we need lsh 
	- mining massive data sets
	- nn complexity
Current LSH and theirs drawbacks 
	- false positives and negatives and why it is so limitting
Which paper is base of our project Who wrote it
	- Rasmus paper
Main idea of the paper what it changes 
	- how different Covering families are from bit sampling
	- why it works
Why it is awesome 
	- is not excluding results - fingerprint scenario

More paperz 
	- Nin paper, mention that Indyk is working on it for nearly 20 years. 
Conclusion. 
	- it works
	- it has performance benefits with not so drastic drawbacks
	- it still could be improved
	- it is already appreciated by the algorithm community
